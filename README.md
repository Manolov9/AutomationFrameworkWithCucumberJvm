# AutomationFrameworkWithCucumberJvm
This is Ready to use Automation Framework with Cucumber-JVM

Hey guys , my name is Cvetan Karchev and I'm from Bulgaria. I'm an QA Automation Lead and I'm educating young talent to became automation engineers in IT Academy. 

I decided to share my automation framework with everybody, so I can help others to learn how to do it. In your lifetime it comes time to give something back. Through some many years I've learned so much and now I want to give something back to the society. All I want from you is to do the same when the time comes. 

# This is Ready to Use Automation Framework with Cucumber-Jvm , Junit and Selenium.

For building the project I use Maven, you need to install it and configure it on your system, also Java JDK and Git.

Choose where you want to put this project on your PC , go to this directory with the shell and execute

git clone https://github.com/shtraker/AutomationFrameworkWithCucumberJvm

You will need Docker and to run a container for the Selenium Server. 

Check out this : 

https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium

I use this image for creating container: 

docker run -v -d -p 4000:4444 -p 5000:5900 selenium/standalone-firefox-debug:2.53.0
